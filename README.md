# David's Python Advent of Code Solutions

This repo is a collection of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions written using modern Python. It's got working code, helpful utilities, and [step-by-step explanations](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code/tree/main/solutions) for many puzzles. Note that it doesn't include my puzzle inputs, per [a request from the creator](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/troubleshooting/no_asking_for_inputs).

The base class and all the helpers are [available as a GitHub template here](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template), if you'd like to use them as well. That repo has documentation for the included programs and Python classes, as well as the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for this project.

## Solutions

Starting in 2020, I started writing a daily post to explain my solution to the day's problem. It's in the README for each day folder.

### Audience

These posts should be accessible to programmers of any skill level, but they're especially geared towards newer programmers. You're expected to be familiar with:

- variables
- functions
- common Python data structures (`list`, `dict`, `set`, etc)
- loops & list comprehensions

Posts assume readers have read all the previous ones from that year, so I won't re-explain something I've already covered (though I may link back to it). I'll typically explain more complex Python patterns, useful stdlib functions, and other ways to approach the puzzle.

### Methodology

Typically I'll solve part 1 and write its half of the post before solving and writing part 2. This helps me write the same way other solvers will read- doing part 1 without knowing what part 2 is.

Sometimes, I'll go back and clean up the part 1 solution or post to serve part 2 better. It may make the whole thing look like I totally knew what I was doing the whole time, but don't let me mislead you - I don't.

Occasionally I don't know how to solve a day. In that case, I take to the [subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) and find a solution I can understand. Then I walk through that solution like a regular post (with attribution) so I make sure I know how it works (and you can too!).

## Feedback

Feedback is encouraged and welcomed! Feel free to open [an issue](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code/issues) on this repo or [get in touch elsewhere](https://xavd.id/contact/). If something could be explained better or is plain wrong, I'd love to hear about it.
