# David's Python Advent of Code Solutions

This repo is a collection of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions written using modern Python. It's got working code, helpful utilities, and [step-by-step explanations](https://advent-of-code.xavd.id) for many puzzles. Note that it doesn't include my puzzle inputs, per [a request from the creator](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/troubleshooting/no_asking_for_inputs).

The base class and all the helpers are [available as a GitHub template here](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template), if you'd like to use them as well. That repo has documentation for the included programs and Python classes, as well as the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for this project.

## Solutions

Starting in 2020, I started writing a daily step-by-step writeup to explain my solution to the day's puzzle. They now live on a standalone blog: https://advent-of-code.xavd.id. There's more info about my approach to puzzle solving there.

## Feedback

Feedback is encouraged and welcomed! Feel free to open [an issue](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code/issues) on this repo or [get in touch elsewhere](https://xavd.id/contact/). If something could be explained better or is plain wrong, I'd love to hear about it.
