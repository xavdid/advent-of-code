# David's Advent of Code Solutions

This repo is a collection of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. It's got working code, helpful utilities, and [step-by-step explanations](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code/tree/main/solutions) for many puzzles. Note that it doesn't include my puzzle inputs, per [a request from the creator](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/troubleshooting/no_asking_for_inputs).

The base class and all the helpers are [available as a GitHub template here](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template), if you'd like to use them as well. That repo has documentation for the included programs and Python classes, as well as the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for this project.
