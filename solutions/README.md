# Solutions

This folder has each all of the solutions, written in Python. Starting in 2020, I started writing a daily post to explain my solution to the day's problem.

## Audience

These posts should be accessible to programmers of any skill level, but they're especially geared towards newer programmers. You're expected to be familiar with:

- variables
- functions
- common Python data structures (`list`, `dict`, `set`, etc)
- loops & list comprehensions

Posts assume readers have read all the previous ones from that year, so I won't re-explain something I've already covered (though I may link back to it). I'll typically explain more complex Python patterns, useful stdlib functions, and other ways to approach the puzzle.

## Methodology

Typically I'll solve part 1 and write its half of the post before solving and writing part 2. This helps me write the same way other solvers will read- doing part 1 without knowing what part 2 is.

Sometimes, I'll go back and clean up the part 1 solution or post to serve part 2 better. It may make the whole thing look like I totally knew what I was doing the whole time, but don't let me mislead you - I don't.

Occasionally I don't know how to solve a day. In that case, I take to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) and find a solution I can understand. Then I walk through that solution like a regular post (with attribution) so I make sure I know how it works (and you can too!).

## Feedback

Feedback is encouraged and welcomed! Feel free to open [an issue](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code/issues/new) on this repo or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xavdid). If something could be explained better or is plain wrong, I'd love to hear about it.
