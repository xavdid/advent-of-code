**Welcome!** This site houses one of my favorite projects: my step-by-step [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) explanations. They're written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and use [my custom solution template](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template) (which handles input parsing, among other tasks). Dive right in by picking a year, or read on to learn more about the project.
